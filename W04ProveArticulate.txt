Week 04 - Articulate: AbstractionMeaning:The principle of abstraction is widely use in computer programming in various languages. It is the process of turning complex ideas into simple ideas. Benefit:Some benefits of abstraction are, to hide unwanted data and show only data that is relevant, abstraction lets you focus on what the object does and not so much on how it does it, and it also helps reduce duplication of information on code.Application:Let me explain its application with a visual comparison that I read while reading about the topic. Let’s say that you are going to a driving school to learn how to drive. There you learn some basic components of a car, break, transmission, battery, gas, etc. But for you to learn how to drive you don’t need to understand at a technical level each car component. You just need a mental image of what the brakes do when you press the foot down. Or what happens to the transmission when you change gears, etc.You only need a basic representation of what the component does. You only need an abstraction of the car component.Example code:Console.WriteLine(“Hello World);This code is in C#, here we just use the Console.Write to output the text “Hello World” to the screen. We don’t need to know how it works under the hood of the car, just understand what that function does.
